::    with hand-crafted post-activation coinbases and verifies that:
::      - honest 1-or-2-miner + fund splits accept,
::      - any deviation in the fund slot rejects with
::        %improper-fund-split (fund missing, wrong amount, wrong key),
::      - the entry-count cap (max-coinbase-split + 1 = 3) holds.
::    Pattern matches mod/integration/asert-activation.hoon: we use a
::    custom blockchain-constants with v1-phase=5 / asert-phase=5 so a
::    handful of blocks reaches the post-activation regime.
