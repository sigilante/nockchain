::
::    Phase-2 cross-check: verify that ASERT targets computed using the
::    cutover constants (the hardcoded asert-anchor-min-timestamp,
::    asert-anchor-target-atom, and asert-anchor-height baked into
::    blockchain-constants:v1) match the targets observed on canonical
::    mainnet for a range of post-activation blocks.
::
::    This is the load-bearing consensus-continuity property: phase-2
::    nodes derive anchor-min-ts by reading a constant instead of walking
::    .blocks / .min-timestamps. If our constant matches the median-of-11
::    the phase-1 walk would have returned at the anchor, then every
::    post-activation target computation produces the same value on
::    phase-2 nodes as it did on phase-1 nodes — by construction. This
::    test pins that property against observed mainnet outputs from the
::    public gRPC node, so any future drift in the polynomial, the
::    constants, or the wrapper plumbing fails CI.
::
::    Vectors are produced by `scripts/aletheia_asert_vectors.rs` against
::    a Nockchain public gRPC node; for each post-activation height N the
::    `parent-min-ts` field is `median-of-11(timestamps[N-11..=N-1])`,
::    matching what `min-timestamps[parent.digest]` holds on a node that
::    just accepted block (N-1). The observed-target is the chain-
::    reported `target.display` for block N (decimal atom).
