::    Regression tests for block-size accounting.
::
::    The v1 $page prepends a `version` head that v0 lacks, so its layout is
::    [version digest pow parent ...] versus v0's [digest pow parent ...] --
::    every field is one axis deeper. +compute-size-without-txs jams the page
::    minus its digest and proof (both are variable-length but bounded, and
::    are accounted for by +max-size constants instead). v0 jams `+>.pag`
::    (axis 7 = [parent ...]); the v1 arm copied that literally, but on a v1
::    page axis 7 is [pow parent ...], so it wrongly folded the proof into the
::    jammed size. A mining candidate carries pow=~ while the mined block
::    carries the full proof, so the miner's +candidate-block-below-max-size
::    guard (run on the candidate) disagreed with consensus +check-size (run
::    on the mined page): a miner would mine a block it then self-rejected as
::    %block-too-large, and the chain could not advance. The fix jams
::    `+>+.pag` (axis 15 = [parent ...]), excluding version, digest, AND pow.
::
::    These tests pin that property: the size of a page excluding its txs must
::    not depend on whether the proof is present.
