::  asert: aserti3-2d difficulty adjustment
::
::    implements the algorithm formalized by jonathan toomim and shipped on
::    bitcoin cash in 2020. pure math, no consensus-state coupling; operates
::    on atoms with bignum conversion at the +compute-target-bn boundary.
::
::    the 2^x approximation is a 3rd-order polynomial whose coefficients are
::    tied to rbits=16. changing rbits requires new polynomial coefficients,
::    so rbits is not a parameter.

::  +poly-factor: 2^(frac/radix) * radix as an integer
::
::    input frac in [0, radix); output in [radix, 2*radix).
::    3rd-order minimax polynomial approximation of 2^x on [0, 1),
::    scaled so that evaluating at frac = y*radix yields factor ≈ 2^y * radix:
::      radix + (195_766_423_245_049*frac
::               + 971_821_376       *frac^2
::               + 5_127             *frac^3
::               + 2^47) >> 48
::    the three normalized coefficients (c_k / 2^((k+1)*16)) sum to ~1 so the
::    approximation satisfies p(0) = 1 and p(1) ≈ 2. the `+ 2^47` term is
::    round-to-nearest for the fixed-point divide by 2^48, matching bch's
::    canonical aserti3-2d so published polynomial vectors reproduce exactly.
::    max error versus 2^x is under 0.13% on [0, 1).
