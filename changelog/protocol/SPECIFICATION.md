# Protocol Upgrade Specification Format

Status: Active
Owner: Nockchain Maintainers
Last Reviewed: 2026-02-19
Canonical/Legacy: Canonical (schema/lifecycle authority for `changelog/protocol/*.md`; top-level protocol index authority is [`PROTOCOL.md`](../../PROTOCOL.md))

Use [`PROTOCOL.md`](../../PROTOCOL.md) as the protocol index and active-upgrade selector.
Canonical protocol source files live under [`changelog/protocol/`](./).
Use this file as the required schema and lifecycle contract for those source files.
This schema document does not supersede `PROTOCOL.md`.

This document defines the format and process for documenting protocol upgrades.

## Overview

Protocol upgrades are changes that require nodes to update. Each upgrade is documented in a single file within this directory, following semver versioning starting from `0.1.0`.

## File Format

Each upgrade specification uses TOML frontmatter followed by Markdown content.

### File Naming

Files are named with a sequential number and a slug:

```
NNN-slug.md
```

Naming eras:

- **Pre-Bythos historical backfill** (`001`-`011`): use `legacy-*` slugs that describe the rule change.
- **Bythos and later** (`012+`): use **Gnostic Aeons** codenames (Bythos, Nous, Aletheia, Logos, Zoe, etc.).

Examples:
- `001-legacy-checkpoint-144.md`
- `012-bythos.md`

The sequential number provides ordering; the semver version in the frontmatter is authoritative.

### TOML Frontmatter

```toml
+++
version = "0.1.0"
status = "draft"  # draft | final | activated | superseded
consensus_critical = true

# Activation (filled in after coordination)
activation_height = 0  # 0 = no consensus-height trigger (not yet determined or rollout-gated)

# Dates
published = "2026-01-19"
activation_target = ""  # ISO date for scheduled activations, should be >= 1 month after published

# People
authors = ["@nockchain-core"]  # handles preferred; "Name <email>" allowed
reviewers = ["@nockchain-core"]  # Required before status can be "final"

# Release-track lineage metadata
supersedes = ""  # previous protocol version on the main release track, if any
superseded_by = ""  # next protocol version on the main release track, if assigned
+++
```

Lineage fields (`supersedes`, `superseded_by`) track release ordering. They do not, by themselves, require `status = "superseded"`.

### Required Sections

Every upgrade specification MUST include the following sections:

#### 1. Summary

A brief (2-3 sentence) description of what the upgrade does. Written for all audiences.

#### 2. Motivation

Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve? Include context for node operators and integrators who may not be familiar with the codebase.

#### 3. Technical Specification

Detailed description of the changes. Include:

- Data structure changes (with before/after examples)
- Encoding/decoding changes
- Consensus rule changes
- API changes

Use code blocks and diagrams where helpful.

#### 4. Activation

- **Height**: The block height at which the upgrade activates, or `0` for rollout-gated activation without a consensus height trigger
- **Coordination**: Any special coordination required during rollout

#### 5. Migration

Instructions for node operators to upgrade:

- Required software version
- Configuration changes (if any)
- Data migration steps (if any)
- Rollback procedure (if applicable)

#### 6. Backward Compatibility

- Is this a breaking change?
- What happens to nodes that don't upgrade?
- What happens to transactions created with old software?

#### 7. Security Considerations

Describe any security-sensitive changes, new assumptions, or threat-model shifts.

#### 8. Operational Impact

Explain operator-facing impacts in actionable terms: what operators MUST do before activation, what can wait until after activation, expected resource/fee/monitoring changes, and failure modes if they do not upgrade in time.

#### 9. Testing and Validation

List required or recommended tests and validation steps (unit/integration/manual).

#### 10. Reference Implementation

Link to the implementation (PR/commit/branch) and any related design docs.

## Status Lifecycle

Normal path:

```
draft → final → activated
```

Replacement path (if activation is withdrawn before it goes live):

```
draft → final → superseded
```

- **draft**: Specification is being developed, subject to change
- **final**: Specification is complete, activation trigger is set (height-based or rollout-gated), awaiting activation
- **activated**: Upgrade is live on mainnet
- **superseded**: This upgrade plan was replaced before activation and is not the current deployment target (set `superseded_by` to the replacement version when known)

An activated historical upgrade may still have `superseded_by` populated to record release-track lineage.

## Process

1. **Draft**: Author creates spec file with `status = "draft"`
2. **Review**: Reviewers listed in frontmatter review the spec
3. **Finalize**: After review, set `status = "final"` and determine activation mechanism (height-based or rollout-gated with `activation_height = 0`)
4. **Announce**: For scheduled activations, publish spec at least 1 month before activation
5. **Activate**: After the activation condition is met (height reached or coordinated rollout complete), set `status = "activated"`
6. **Replace (optional)**: If a finalized plan is replaced before activation, set `status = "superseded"` and set `superseded_by` to the replacement version

## Versioning Rules

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking consensus changes that may fork non-upgraded nodes
- **Minor** (0.X.0): Consensus changes that are backward-compatible or have graceful degradation
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Non-consensus changes that still require node updates (e.g., P2P protocol, RPC changes)

Since all changes in this repository are tracked together, even non-consensus changes that require node updates should be documented here.

## Machine-Readable Metadata

The TOML frontmatter can be parsed programmatically. The frontmatter is delimited by `+++` markers:

```
+++
[toml content]
+++

[markdown content]
```

Tools can extract metadata for:
- Generating upgrade timelines
- Checking activation status
- Building compatibility matrices
- Automating release notes

## Template

A minimal template for new upgrade specifications:

```markdown
+++
version = "X.Y.Z"
status = "draft"
consensus_critical = true

activation_height = 0
published = "YYYY-MM-DD"
activation_target = ""

authors = ["@nockchain-core"]  # handles preferred; "Name <email>" allowed
reviewers = ["@nockchain-core"]

supersedes = ""
superseded_by = ""
+++
