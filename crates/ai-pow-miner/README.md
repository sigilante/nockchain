# `ai-pow-miner`

`ai-pow-miner` is the external miner for Nockchain's `%ai-pow` puzzle. It searches Pearl-compatible dense and grouped-GEMM ticket attempts, creates a compact recursive certificate only after a target hit, and submits the canonical block artifact to a node.

The `ai-pow-mine` binary is enabled by the `node` feature. The default library build keeps the ticket loop available without the NockApp and gRPC dependency tree.

## Place in the system

```text
nockchain kernel --%mine-ai effect--> ai-pow-mine
       ^                                  |
       |                                  +-- Pearl-style work attempt
       |                                  +-- Nockchain target check
       |                                  +-- compact certificate on hit
       +-------- %ai-pow poke ------------+
                         \
                          +-- optional Pearl Gateway submission
```

`nockchain-mining-common` supplies the private gRPC client and candidate decoding. `ai-pow` owns the work statement and Pearl compatibility. `ai-pow-zk` proves it. `ai-pow-jets` and the Hoon kernel independently verify every submitted block.

## Modes

- **Node-connected mining:** watches `%mine-ai` effects and submits `%ai-pow` commands through the private NockApp gRPC service.
- **Canonical CPU mode:** constructs valid Nockchain certificates without a Pearl Gateway; intended for fakenet and integration verification rather than competitive throughput.
- **Pearl merge mining:** evaluates one Pearl-compatible work instance and may submit the same hit to Pearl and Nockchain when their independent targets are met.

## Maintained invariants

- A candidate supplies the block commitment, AI target, and puzzle variant. The miner never chooses consensus target or fork-choice weight.
- Every extranonce is upstream of `kappa`, matrix commitments, noise, noised matrices, tile state, and jackpot. A new mining attempt rebuilds nonce-bound state; a nonce-only hash loop is forbidden.
- A recursive certificate is generated only after the ticket's jackpot satisfies the Nockchain target. The node repeats the target and proof checks.
- The certificate and opaque nonce envelope commit to the same Pearl transcript and Nockchain block commitment.
- Pearl auxiliary inclusion contains exactly one Nockchain commitment, preventing one Pearl proof from authorizing multiple Nockchain blocks.
- Dense and MoE artifacts use explicit, canonical variants. Routing, expert-local dimensions, opened schedules, and matrix commitments remain proof-bound.
- Candidate replacement cancels stale work. A proof for an old commitment cannot validate against a new block.
- Hoon sees only the versioned `%ai-pow` artifact and opaque `[len data]` nonce. Pearl gateway metadata never becomes a consensus-kernel concept.

## Trust boundaries

The miner is untrusted from consensus's perspective. Successful local verification is an optimization and diagnostic; only the node's Hoon rules plus mandatory Rust verify jet admit a block. Private gRPC gives kernel-level poke access and should be bound to a trusted local interface.

Merge mining shares a mineable work unit, not a proof system or chain target. Pearl and Nockchain retain independent acceptance, targets, block commitments, and submission paths.

## Soundness dependencies

The miner relies on `ai-pow` for Pearl byte compatibility and attempt binding, and on `ai-pow-zk` for certificate construction. Its security-sensitive obligations are canonical serialization, exact statement construction, fresh per-attempt work, and refusal to substitute prover-controlled setup or public parameters. Cryptographic acceptance properties are documented in [`../ai-pow-zk/docs/SECURITY.md`](../ai-pow-zk/docs/SECURITY.md).

## GPU container configuration

Build the Linux/amd64 production image:

```sh
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -f docker/Dockerfile.ai-pow-miner-gpu \
  -t ai-pow-miner-gpu .
```

The image mines to `2nFsk7KTv9Fm5zMU3ckWAM4p9eLhUSVeVEKUoPFkfzehyjuzmpXAN8j` by default. Set `MINING_PKH` to direct rewards to a different v1 mining public-key hash. `NODE_ADDR` is required.

```sh
docker run --rm --gpus all \
  -e NODE_ADDR=http://node.example:5555 \
  -e MINING_PKH=<v1-mining-pkh> \
  ai-pow-miner-gpu
```

The image uses CUDA device `0`, canonical mode, and batches of 32,768 attempts by default. Set `CUDA_DEVICE`, `CANONICAL`, or `GPU_BATCH_ATTEMPTS` to override these values. Non-canonical mode also requires `PEARL_GATEWAY`.

## Validation

```sh
cargo test -p ai-pow-miner
cargo test -p ai-pow-miner --all-features
cargo run --release -p ai-pow-miner --features node --bin ai-pow-mine -- --help
```
