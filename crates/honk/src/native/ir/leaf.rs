//! Provenanced owned leaves for the native IR (plan §3.9, RT-04).
//!
//! Formulas (and, for typed Dynock, types) carry noun leaves: quoted constants
//! (`[1 const]`), hint clues, dbug spot tuples. A **bare `Noun`** leaf is an
//! alien-pointer hazard, so the IR carries an owned, provenance-free
//! representation: a small direct atom inline, or owned jam bytes for anything
//! larger. `to_noun` materializes the leaf into a destination slab through a
//! checked copy (never splicing a foreign pointer). The production copy-cache
//! lives in `docs/native-compiler/PHASE0-PROVENANCE-DESIGN.md`; this is the
//! Phase-1 shadow form.
